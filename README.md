# Crunch-Database
In this assignment, I develop a key value store database called CrunchDB in the Java programming language using dynamic data structures. All entries to the database contain a unique key which will map to a set of values. Each entry of the database is identified by a unique key string and contains a dynamically sized list of integer values.

## Description
A program in Java that implements CrunchDB as shown in the examples below. Since this assignment is an introduction to Java, test cases will contain only valid input commands and not cause any integer overflows. Keys are case sensitive and do not contain spaces. Commands are case insensitive.
Entry values are indexed from 1. Snapshots are indexed from 1 and are unique for the lifetime of the program. Keys, entries and snapshots are to be outputted in the order from most recently added to least recently added. Snapshots can be archived in a human-readable text file, storing all entries in the following form <entry_key>|[<entries>,...]}
Archived snapshots can be restored by CrunchDB, resetting the data to the archived snapshotâ€™s state. The program can be contained in the provided scaffold of CrunchDB.java, Snapshot.java and Entry.java. The program reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

## Commands
The program implements the following commands.
* If a <key> does not exist in the current state, output: no such key
* If a <snapshot> does not exist in the database, output: no such snapshot
* If an <index> does not exist in an entry, output: index out of range
